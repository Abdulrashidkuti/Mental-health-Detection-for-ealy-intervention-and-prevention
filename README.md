Mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and emotional distress have become increasingly prevalent, particularly among young adults. Early identification and intervention are critical in preventing long-term psychological damage. This project proposes a machine learning-based approach to detect potential mental health conditions using self-reported symptom data. The dataset comprises variables such as sleep disturbance, appetite changes, suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and panic attacks. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection. Multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest, were evaluated to determine the most accurate model. Among them, the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 88%. The model was further integrated into an interactive interface that allows users to input symptom data and receive predictions in real-time. The result demonstrates the feasibility of deploying artificial intelligence as a supportive tool for early mental health screening and as a decision aid for mental health professionals.
